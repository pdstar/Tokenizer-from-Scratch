# Tokenizer from Scratch
## Coding a Tokenizer from Scratch


Here I built a tokenizer from scratch to practice and got familiar with how tokenization works. 

Thankfully, there are frameworks that can help with creating and using tokenizers, such as Hugging Face's tokenizers library(opens in a new tab). But for this exercise, I did it from scratch for learning purposes.

## Key steps:
1. Implement Normalization function for custom tokenizer
2. Implement pretokentizer function in the custom tokenizer
3. Implement tokenization step in the custom tokenizer
4. Implement peeprocessing step in the custom tokenizer
5. Create encoder to encode text to token IDs using custom tokenizer
6. Create decoder to decode tokenIDs to text using custom tokenizer
